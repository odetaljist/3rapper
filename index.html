		<p>2018 XXL Freshman is almost here. Before the annual Freshman Class cover is revealed, it's time to cast your vote for the 10th spot. Starting today (March 26), XXL launches the voting for the 10 spot for the 2018 XXL Freshman class presented by Underground Rappers. This is where you, the fans, get to pick one of the artists to be featured in the 2018 XXL Freshman Class.
<br/><br/>
You can even vote once every four hours so keep it locked to the voting page. Previous 10th spot winners include Dizzy Wright, Jarren Benton, Iggy Azalea, Kidd Kidd, Lil Yachty and XXXTentacion.
<br/><br/>
The polls will stay open for the next seven days ending on April 1 at midnight, so there is plenty of time for fans to make their vote count. Remember to use the official hashtag when promoting on social media: #XXLFreshmen. And make sure you’re following XXL on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to be one of the first to find out when the entire 2018 XXL Freshman Class is announced.
<br/><br/>
One of the best parts of the XXL Freshman experience is watching the cyphers, freestyles and pitches from the previous years. Head to the XXL YouTube page to check out the 2017 XXL Freshman Class, which featured A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, Aminé, Kap G, Kamaiyah, Kyle, Madeintyo, Playboi Carti, PnB Rock, Ugly God and 10th spot winner XXXTentacion.
